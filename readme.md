There are a few ways to use your own image:

1. Method 1: Create a directory with the EXACT directory name of 'backtotop' in your theme root directory and place an image with the EXACT file name of 'backtotop.png' or 'backtotop.jpg' or 'backtotop.jpeg' or 'backtotop.gif'. If you have multiple image files, the image will load in that order.
2. Method 2: Use the filter 'back-to-top-image' as follows in your theme's functions.php:

    if(has_filter('back-to-top-image')){
        add_filter( 'back-to-top-image', 'add_back_to_top_image' );
	}
	function add_back_to_top_image(){
		return URL_TO_THE_IMAGE_HERE;
